## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.git
cd cpu-scheduling-algorithms
```

### 2. Run the Backend Server

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will start running locally (default: `http://localhost:5000`).

### 3. Run the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Open the HTML file in any browser of your choice:
   - Directly double-click the HTML file.
   - **OR**, if using VS Code, right-click on the HTML file and select `Open with Live Server`.
